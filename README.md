# TODOs:
1. Make a better README.md, explaining functionality and usage
2. Make a catchall argument which catches all the command line parameters to be passed to ftpp, so things like source encoding, stats, resampling, etc can be done.
3. Deal with multiple files which need to be merged. Not sure how. Detect same date?
